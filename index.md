It’s not hard to compose a room that will uplift you. Any one of these would do:

* A wall covered in fake ivy—it’s not trying to be real ivy—it doesn’t care, and the wall is International Orange, the color of the Golden Gate Bridge, but you can hardly see it.
* An angled mirror outside the window, pointing up to the sky.
* A demin wall, a wall of denim, used denim, from Goodwill.
* A waterfall coming out of the keys of an old piano, apparently playable from stepping stones on a koi pond.
* Four (comfortable) sage green toilets around a clear glass table. Not attached to plumbing, of course. You can't attach tables to plumbing.
* Fifty oil lamps. 50.
* “Of course” painted in pure white on your inoffensive off-white walls.

My name is Michael K. Cohen.

I am a PhD student studying computer science at Oxford.

“Michael,” you say, “What is your vision for my home?”

[Contact me](mailto:mkc1000@gmail.com), and I'll tell you.

“And what do you charge, Michael?”

If you decline my grand designs, in your cowardice, you owe me nothing, of course. And what is the source of that cowardice, I wonder? Do you fear the look of confusion in your spouse’s eyes (more discomfitting than any affected expression), as they begin to wonder whether they’re still married to an unmistakably-sane-and-sensible™ person? If so, friend, best move along. Let us all be sane and sensible and easily mistaken for the opposite. But I digress. You pay me what you think you owe me.

If you are as fabulously wealthy in funds as I know you are in spirit, I suppose my work may be worth quite a lot to you! I do not manage installations—I only sell ideas and, when appropriate, url links to materials and furniture. Managing installations... what if I *messed it up*?
<!---I suggest $512 / room-defining idea; $64 / minor touch. (Only the ideas you actually take! Only after the room is complete!) If you are as fabulously wealthy in funds as I know you are in spirit, I suppose my work may be worth more to you!

One final point that *cannot* be belabored: I may suggest you exhibit a particular Sol LeWitt drawing. These are, of course, free. They are straightforward to draw yourself. To anyone who has purchased a Certificate of Authenticity for a Sol LeWitt drawing, I ask you this: have you *even* read Walter Benjamin’s *The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction?* A Sol LeWitt certificate is the antithesis of a Sol LeWitt work. What are you doing?
